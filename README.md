## Python
Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, widely used programming language that emphasizes code readability and allows programmers to express concepts in less lines of code in comparisson to other languages.
Python is popular for web development, big data, science, and scripting.  
Python comes with it's own standard libraries, and has a wide range of third-party libraries.

#### Pros
* Easy to learn/read
* Supports multiple platforms
* Object Orientated
* Large number of resources and libraries
* Uses less lines of code 

#### Cons
* Slow
* Limitations with database access
* Absence from Mobile Applications

### Why use Python?
#### Beginner Friendliness
Python was designed to be easy to read and understand. Python's layout has helped it become the most popular introductory language to new programmers. Since Python has a wide range of third-party libraries, it has a gradual learning curve that helps you build off the foundation of the basic funcionalitites.

#### Easy to Understand
The implication with Python is that anyone can come along and read it almost like English, which makes it easier for coding beginners. Since Python is a very high-level language, it is easy to read and understand.
